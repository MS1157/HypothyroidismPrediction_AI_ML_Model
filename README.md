# HypothyroidismPrediction_AI_ML_Model
"Predicts hypothyroidism using machine learning algorithms."
This repository contains the code and resources for an AI/ML model designed to predict hypothyroidism.

## Introduction
Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is a common endocrine disorder. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing complications. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict hypothyroidism based on patient data, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses.
Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy.
#Common symptoms include: tiredness,being sensitive to cold,weight gain,constipation,depression etc.
